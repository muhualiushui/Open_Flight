## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
   
     We will decide on each person's job at the beginning. Before that, we will ask each person's job intention to assign the right job for each person. If there are any unexpected, we will use social media to communicate as soon as possible.
5. **Time Commitment** 
    
    8 hours each group member per week. If a conflict arises, actively communicate and try to handle the issue. Ensure that the expected tasks can be completed by the deadline.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    Confliction for time: 
        
    If any team member exists an emergency and can not attend the meeting on time, we would arrange a new meeting that everyone is free to attend. 
	
    If a team member is habitually late out of others’ tolerance for every meeting, we would create a deposit and charge him or her for this late, and eat dinner together by this deposit at the end day of the project.

    Confliction for Algorism:
    
    If we face some destruction for selecting different algorism choosing in this final project. We would pick one of the fastest to be used.
    
    Confliction for incapability to complete tasks: 
    
    We understand everyone has their own weakness. During the entire period of the final project. If anyone has difficulty accomplishing his or her task, others would provide some help or hints for him or her.

    If we exist some problem that can not be solved, we would tell our mentor.
